# TODO: Add OpenAPI Documentation

## Plan
- Install swagger-jsdoc and swagger-ui-express packages.
- Configure swagger in server.js to generate docs from JSDoc comments in route files.
- Serve the API documentation at /api-docs endpoint.
- Test the documentation by running the server and accessing /api-docs.

## Steps
- [x] Install required packages: swagger-jsdoc and swagger-ui-express.
- [x] Update server.js to include swagger setup and middleware.
- [x] Verify JSDoc comments in route files are compatible with OpenAPI generation.
- [x] Run the server and check /api-docs for the generated documentation.
- [x] Fix JSDoc comments to use @swagger tags with OpenAPI YAML format for proper generation.
