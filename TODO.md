# Remove System Logs from Admin Dashboard

## Plan Execution Steps:

### 1. Remove logs section from admin dashboard HTML
- [x] Remove the entire "System Logs Section" from `public/pages/admin-dashboard.html`
- [x] Remove the script reference to `admin-logs.js`

### 2. Remove admin logs JavaScript functionality
- [x] Delete `public/js/admin-logs.js` file entirely

### 3. Remove backend logs routes
- [x] Remove the logs route registration from `src/server.js`
- [x] Delete `src/routes/logs.js` file

### 4. Evaluate and clean up Log model and logger service
- [x] Check if `src/models/Log.js` is used elsewhere in the application - NOT USED elsewhere
- [x] Check if `src/services/logger.js` is used elsewhere in the application - USED for general application logging
- [x] Delete `src/models/Log.js` since it's only used for admin dashboard logs
- [x] Keep `src/services/logger.js` since it's used for general application logging
- [x] Clean up log files in `src/logs/` directory - KEEP log files since logger service is still used for general application logging

### 5. Testing and verification
- [ ] Verify the admin dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] Test that other admin functionality still works
